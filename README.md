# StudentManagementAPI
This project is a Student Management System built using .NET 8 Web API with Entity Framework Core and a SQLite database. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing student records (add, view, update, delete). A simple HTML + JavaScript frontend dashboard is included to interact with the API visually.
